This project was written using only vanilla JS, html and CSS.

Productivity Boost is a todo list that can organize your various daily tasks and mark them as completed when you're done!

## Features include:

- Saving your todo tasks with a description, priority and date when the task was created. âœ”
- Sorting your tasks according to priority or date, in ascending or descending order. âœ”
- Sorting your tasks as you please by dragging them to the desired location in the list. âœ”
- Adding your todo tasks to the 'completed todos' section where you can view the tasks which you've completed and be proud of yourself. âœ”
- Sorting completed todos the same way you'd sort regular todos. âœ”
- Dragging your todos to the 'completed todos' section, which will also add them there.
- Deleting any of your todos or completed todos. âœ”
- Also your todolist will be persistent! It, along with all of your actions like adding, deleting or completing todos are saved online. âœ”
- Works on mobile devices and medium screens! âœ”

## My thoughts:

This was a very fun project for me, definitely got to refine most of what I've learned so far! I did my best to commit & push as early and as many times as I could, you can clearly see my whole working process through my 40+ commits. I've also tried to describe every small thing I've added and issue I had, and to spread my work evenly throughout the given timeframe.

## Resources:

The persistance of the todo-list is achieved with jsonbin.io

This resource was very handy for working with the API:

Implementing drag & drop was challenging. I've used these amazing guides for it:

https://javascript.info/mouse-drag-and-drop

For styling I have used this awesome gradient generator:

I've used icons from font-awesome for my footer:

And countless of other tabs of MDN, w3schools and stackoverflow which have all helped me understand better the intricacies of JS, HTML and CSS.
